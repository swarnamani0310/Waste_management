# Waste_management using CNN model
Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying waste materials into distinct categories using deep learning techniques, with the goal of automating waste management and improving recycling efficiency. The dataset used in this project consists of images representing different types of waste, categorized into labels such as organic and recyclable materials. The images are preprocessed and structured into a pandas DataFrame, allowing for efficient analysis and model training. The data preprocessing pipeline involves reading images from the dataset, converting them to the RGB color space, and storing them alongside their corresponding labels. The processed data can then be used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks. This project also emphasizes the importance of data visualization by using pie charts to understand the distribution of waste categories. The ultimate goal is to build a robust classification model that can accurately identify waste types, facilitating better waste sorting and recycling processes. Future improvements may include data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization, hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance, and potential deployment options using web frameworks such as Flask or FastAPI. With further development and optimization, this project can serve as a stepping stone for implementing AI-driven waste management systems in smart cities and industrial environments.
